This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5.

Response:
It seems there was an error because the `metric_service.csv` file does not contain the `cmdb_id` and `kpi_name` columns. Instead, it has different columns such as `service`, `rr`, `sr`, `mrt`, and `count`. I will adjust the code to handle the `metric_service.csv` file correctly by using the appropriate column names.

Let's correct the code and calculate the global P95 thresholds again, this time taking into account the different schema of the `metric_service.csv` file.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

Request:
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a DevOps assistant for writing Python code to answer DevOps questions. For each question, you need to write Python code to solve it by retrieving and processing telemetry data of the target system. Your generated Python code will be automatically submitted to a IPython Kernel. The execution result output in IPython Kernel will be used as the answer to the question.\n\n## RULES OF PYTHON CODE WRITING:\n\n1. Reuse variables as much as possible for execution efficiency since the IPython Kernel is stateful, i.e., variables define in previous steps can be used in subsequent steps. \n2. Use variable name rather than `print()` to display the execution results since your Python environment is IPython Kernel rather than Python.exe. If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5. Do not simulate any virtual situation or assume anything unknown. Solve the real problem.\n6. Do not store any data as files in the disk. Only cache the data as variables in the memory.\n7. Do not visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python. You can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n8. Do not generate anything else except the Python code block except the instruction tell you to \'Use plain English\'. If you find the input instruction is a summarization task (which is typically happening in the last step), you should comprehensively summarize the conclusion as a string in your code and display it directly.\n9. Do not calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration. Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n10. All issues use **UTC+8** time. However, the local machine\'s default timezone is unknown.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

Response:
The global P95 thresholds for each 'component-KPI' time series within the `metric_container.csv` file for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, have been calculated. The results provide the 95th percentile value for various KPIs across different components, which include both nodes and pods. These thresholds can be used to identify anomalies or performance issues when monitoring the system's telemetry data. The thresholds vary for each component and KPI, indicating the different performance characteristics and resource usage patterns of each component in the system.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step. In each step, your response should follow the JSON format below:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a DevOps assistant for writing Python code to answer DevOps questions. For each question, you need to write Python code to solve it by retrieving and processing telemetry data of the target system. Your generated Python code will be automatically submitted to a IPython Kernel. The execution result output in IPython Kernel will be used as the answer to the question.\n\n## RULES OF PYTHON CODE WRITING:\n\n1. Reuse variables as much as possible for execution efficiency since the IPython Kernel is stateful, i.e., variables define in previous steps can be used in subsequent steps. \n2. Use variable name rather than `print()` to display the execution results since your Python environment is IPython Kernel rather than Python.exe. If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5. Do not simulate any virtual situation or assume anything unknown. Solve the real problem.\n6. Do not store any data as files in the disk. Only cache the data as variables in the memory.\n7. Do not visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python. You can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n8. Do not generate anything else except the Python code block except the instruction tell you to \'Use plain English\'. If you find the input instruction is a summarization task (which is typically happening in the last step), you should comprehensively summarize the conclusion as a string in your code and display it directly.\n9.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

Response:
During the failure duration from 09:00 to 09:30 on March 20, 2022, there were anomalies detected in the `metric_container.csv` data for cloudbed-1. These anomalies are instances where the KPI values exceeded the global P95 thresholds that were previously calculated. The anomalies span across various components and KPIs, such as `container_fs_writes_MB` on `/dev/vda` for `shippingservice-1` and `container_network_transmit_packets` on `eth0` for `paymentservice-2`. There are a total of 274 anomalies identified within the specified time frame, indicating potential performance issues or abnormal behavior in the system.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'. Respond \'None\' if it is the first step.),\n    "completed": ("True" if you believe the issue is resolved, and an answer can be derived in the \'instruction\' field.

{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a DevOps assistant for writing Python code to answer DevOps questions. For each question, you need to write Python code to solve it by retrieving and processing telemetry data of the target system. Your generated Python code will be automatically submitted to a IPython Kernel. The execution result output in IPython Kernel will be used as the answer to the question.\n\n## RULES OF PYTHON CODE WRITING:\n\n1. Reuse variables as much as possible for execution efficiency since the IPython Kernel is stateful, i.e., variables define in previous steps can be used in subsequent steps. \n2. Use variable name rather than `print()` to display the execution results since your Python environment is IPython Kernel rather than Python.exe. If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5. Do not simulate any virtual situation or assume anything unknown. Solve the real problem.\n6. Do not store any data as files in the disk. Only cache the data as variables in the memory.\n7. Do not visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python. You can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n8. Do not generate anything else except the Python code block except the instruction tell you to \'Use plain English\'. If you find the input instruction is a summarization task (which is typically happening in the last step), you should comprehensively summarize the conclusion as a string in your code and display it directly.\n9. Do not calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration. Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n10. All issues use **UTC+8** time.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

Response:
The analysis of the `metric_container.csv` data for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30 has identified 73 instances of consecutive anomalies where the KPI values not only exceeded the global P95 thresholds but also did so significantly, with the value being more than 50% above the threshold. These consecutive anomalies are indicative of persistent faults within the system, as opposed to isolated incidents. The affected components include various services such as `cartservice`, `checkoutservice`, and `shippingservice`, among others, with KPIs related to CPU throttling, memory failures, and network receive metrics. This information is crucial for pinpointing the root cause of the system's faults during the specified time frame.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step. In each step, your response should follow the JSON format below:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'. Respond \'None\' if it is the first step.),\n    "completed": ("True" if you believe the issue is resolved, and an answer can be derived in the \'instruction\' field. Otherwise "False"),\n    "instruction": (Your instruction for the Executor to perform via code execution in the next step. Do not involve complex multi-step instruction. Keep your instruction atomic, with clear request of \'what to do\' and \'how to do\'. Respond a summary by yourself if you believe the issue is resolved.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

Response:
The trace analysis for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30 has identified traces that include faulty components previously determined from the metric analysis. Within these traces, the last (most downstream) faulty components have been identified, which are likely to be the root cause components in the call chain. The components identified as the most downstream faulty components in the traces include `productcatalogservice-0`, `currencyservice-1`, `productcatalogservice-1`, and `currencyservice-0`. These components are candidates for the root cause of the faults observed during the specified time frame, as they appear at the end of the affected traces, indicating that the issue may have originated from or was last observed in these components.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

Your generated Python code will be automatically submitted to a IPython Kernel. The execution result output in IPython Kernel will be used as the answer to the question.\n\n## RULES OF PYTHON CODE WRITING:\n\n1. Reuse variables as much as possible for execution efficiency since the IPython Kernel is stateful, i.e., variables define in previous steps can be used in subsequent steps. \n2. Use variable name rather than `print()` to display the execution results since your Python environment is IPython Kernel rather than Python.exe. If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5. Do not simulate any virtual situation or assume anything unknown. Solve the real problem.\n6. Do not store any data as files in the disk. Only cache the data as variables in the memory.\n7. Do not visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python. You can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n8. Do not generate anything else except the Python code block except the instruction tell you to \'Use plain English\'. If you find the input instruction is a summarization task (which is typically happening in the last step), you should comprehensively summarize the conclusion as a string in your code and display it directly.\n9. Do not calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration. Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n10. All issues use **UTC+8** time. However, the local machine\'s default timezone is unknown. Please use `pytz.timezone(\'Asia/Shanghai\')` to explicityly set the timezone to UTC+8.\n\n\nThere is some domain knowledge for you:\n\n## TELEMETRY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:\n\n- You can access the telemetry directories of two cloudbed (i.e., `cloudbed-1` and `cloudbed-2`) in our microservices system: `dataset/Market/cloudbed-1/telemetry/` and `dataset/Market/cloudbed-2/telemetry/`.\n\n- This directory contains subdirectories organized by a date (e.g., `dataset/Market/cloudbed-1/telemetry/2022_03_20/`). \n\n- Within each date-specific directory, you¡¯ll find these subdirectories: `metric`, `trace`, and `log` (e.g., `dataset/Market/cloudbed-1/telemetry/2022_03_20/metric/`).\n\n- The telemetry data in those subdirectories is stored in CSV format (e.g., `dataset/Market/cloudbed-1/telemetry/2022_03_20/metric/metric_container.csv`).\n\n## DATA SCHEMA\n\n1.  **Metric Files**:\n    \n    1. `metric_container.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,kpi_name,value\n        1647781200,node-6.adservice2-0,container_fs_writes_MB./dev/vda,0.0\n        ```\n\n    2. `metric_mesh.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,kpi_name,value\n        1647790380,cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart,istio_tcp_sent_bytes.-,1255.0\n        ```\n\n    3. `metric_node.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,kpi_name,value\n        1647705600,node-1,system.cpu.iowait,0.31\n        ```\n\n    4. `metric_runtime.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,kpi_name,value\n        1647730800,adservice.ts:8088,java_nio_BufferPool_TotalCapacity.direct,57343.0\n        ```\n\n    5. `metric_service.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        service,timestamp,rr,sr,mrt,count\n        adservice-grpc,1647716400,100.0,100.0,2.429508196728182,61\n        ```\n\n2.  **Trace Files**:\n\n    1. `trace_span.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        timestamp,cmdb_id,span_id,trace_id,duration,type,status_code,operation_name,parent_span\n        1647705600361,frontend-0,a652d4d10e9478fc,9451fd8fdf746a80687451dae4c4e984,49877,rpc,0,hipstershop.CheckoutService/PlaceOrder,952754a738a11675\n        ```\n\n3.  **Log Files**:\n\n    1. `log_proxy.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        log_id,timestamp,cmdb_id,log_name,value\n        KN43pn8BmS57GQLkQUdP,1647761110,cartservice-1,log_cartservice-service_application,etCartAsync called with userId=3af80013-c2c1-4ae6-86d0-1d9d308e6f5b\n        ```\n\n    2. `log_service.csv`:\n\n        ```csv\n        log_id,timestamp,cmdb_id,log_name,value\n        GIvpon8BDiVcQfZwJ5a9,1647705660,currencyservice-0,log_currencyservice-service_application,"severity: info, message: Getting supported currencies..."\n        ```\n\n## POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE COMPONENTS:\n\n(if the root cause is at the node level, i.e., the root cause is a specific node)\n- node-1\n- node-2\n- node-3\n- node-4\n- node-5\n- node-6\n\n(if the root cause is at the pod level, i.e., the root cause is a specific container)\n\n- frontend-0\n- frontend-1\n- frontend-2\n- frontend2-0\n- shippingservice-0\n- shippingservice-1\n- shippingservice-2\n- shippingservice2-0\n- checkoutservice-0\n- checkoutservice-1\n- checkoutservice-2\n- checkoutservice2-0\n- currencyservice-0\n- currencyservice-1\n- currencyservice-2\n- currencyservice2-0\n- adservice-0\n- adservice-1\n- adservice-2\n- adservice2-0\n- emailservice-0\n- emailservice-1\n- emailservice-2\n- emailservice2-0\n- cartservice-0\n- cartservice-1\n- cartservice-2\n- cartservice2-0\n- productcatalogservice-0\n- productcatalogservice-1\n- productcatalogservice-2\n- productcatalogservice2-0\n- recommendationservice-0\n- recommendationservice-1\n- recommendationservice-2\n- recommendationservice2-0\n- paymentservice-0\n- paymentservice-1\n- paymentservice-2\n- paymentservice2-0\n\n(if the root cause is at the service level, i.e., if all pods of a specific service are faulty, the root cause is the service itself)\n\n- frontend\n- shippingservice\n- checkoutservice\n- currencyservice\n- adservice\n- emailservice\n- cartservice\n- productcatalogservice\n- recommendationservice\n- paymentservice\n\n## POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE REASONS:\n\n- container CPU load\n- container memory load\n- container network packet retransmission \n- container network packet corruption\n- container network latency \n- container packet loss \n- container process termination\n- container read I/O load\n- container write I/O load\n- node CPU load\n- node CPU spike\n- node memory consumption\n- node disk read I/O consumption \n- node disk write I/O consumption \n- node disk space consumption\n\n## CLARIFICATION OF TELEMETRY DATA:\n\n1. This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

Response:
The log analysis for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30 has revealed a significant number of log entries related to the components identified as the most downstream faulty components in the trace analysis: `productcatalogservice-0`, `currencyservice-1`, `productcatalogservice-1`, and `currencyservice-0`. The logs include entries for both proxy and application logs, indicating various activities such as HTTP POST requests to the CurrencyService and informational messages about currency conversion requests and supported currencies retrieval.

The presence of these log entries suggests that these components were active and processing requests during the failure duration. However, to determine the root cause component and the root cause reason, we would need to look for specific error messages, exceptions, or other indicators of failure within these logs. The provided execution result does not include such details due to the truncation of the output.

To conclusively identify the root cause component and reason, a detailed examination of the full log entries for the specified components during the failure duration would be necessary, focusing on any abnormal patterns, error messages, or exceptions that could indicate the nature of the faults.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'. Respond \'None\' if it is the first step.),\n    "completed": ("True" if you believe the issue is resolved, and an answer can be derived in the \'instruction\' field.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

Response:
The examination of the full log entries for `productcatalogservice-0`, `currencyservice-1`, `productcatalogservice-1`, and `currencyservice-0` from both `log_proxy.csv` and `log_service.csv` for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30 did not reveal any error messages, exceptions, or other indicators of failure in the earliest entries within this time frame. The result is an empty DataFrame, which suggests that there were no log entries containing typical keywords associated with failures such as "error," "exception," "fail," "critical," or "severe."

Without such indicators in the logs, we cannot conclusively identify the root cause component and reason based on the log analysis alone. Further investigation may be required, potentially involving a deeper look into the logs beyond just the earliest entries or considering additional sources of telemetry data.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

Response:
{
    "analysis": "The log analysis did not reveal any error messages, exceptions, or other indicators of failure for the components `productcatalogservice-0`, `currencyservice-1`, `productcatalogservice-1`, and `currencyservice-0`. This suggests that the logs during the failure duration do not contain explicit evidence of the root cause. Given that the logs did not provide the necessary information, we should revisit the metric analysis and trace analysis results to identify the root cause component and reason. From the metric analysis, we have identified significant faults in various components. The trace analysis pointed to the last (most downstream) faulty components in the call chain. Since we have multiple faulty components at the service level, the root cause component is typically the last faulty service within a trace. However, we have two services (`productcatalogservice` and `currencyservice`) with multiple instances identified as faulty. To determine the root cause component among these services, we should identify which service instance appears as the last faulty component in the majority of the affected traces.",

Request:
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a DevOps assistant for writing Python code to answer DevOps questions. For each question, you need to write Python code to solve it by retrieving and processing telemetry data of the target system. Your generated Python code will be automatically submitted to a IPython Kernel. The execution result output in IPython Kernel will be used as the answer to the question.\n\n## RULES OF PYTHON CODE WRITING:\n\n1. Reuse variables as much as possible for execution efficiency since the IPython Kernel is stateful, i.e., variables define in previous steps can be used in subsequent steps. \n2. Use variable name rather than `print()` to display the execution results since your Python environment is IPython Kernel rather than Python.exe. If you want to display multiple variables, use commas to separate them, e.g. `var1, var2`.\n3. Use pandas Dataframe to process and display tabular data for efficiency and briefness. Avoid transforming Dataframe to list or dict type for display.\n4. If you encounter an error or unexpected result, rewrite the code by referring to the given IPython Kernel error message.\n5. Do not simulate any virtual situation or assume anything unknown. Solve the real problem.\n6. Do not store any data as files in the disk. Only cache the data as variables in the memory.\n7. Do not visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python. You can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n8. Do not generate anything else except the Python code block except the instruction tell you to \'Use plain English\'. If you find the input instruction is a summarization task (which is typically happening in the last step), you should comprehensively summarize the conclusion as a string in your code and display it directly.\n9. Do not calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration. Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n10. All issues use **UTC+8** time. However, the local machine\'s default timezone is unknown.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\nYour response should follow the Python block format below:\n\n```python\n(YOUR CODE HERE)\n```'}

Response:
The re-analysis of the `trace_span.csv` file for cloudbed-1 on March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30 has determined that `productcatalogservice-0` appears most frequently as the last faulty component in the affected traces, with a total of 1573 occurrences. This is followed by `productcatalogservice-1` with 1286 occurrences, `currencyservice-1` with 407 occurrences, and `currencyservice-0` with 204 occurrences.

Based on this information, `productcatalogservice-0` is the most likely root cause component among the multiple faulty services, as it is the most common last component in the traces during the time of the failure.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

Response:
The review of the anomalies detected in the `metric_container.csv` data for `productcatalogservice-0` during the failure duration from 09:00 to 09:30 on March 20, 2022, has identified the KPI `container_memory_failures.container.pgfault` as showing the most significant deviation from its global P95 threshold. The value of this KPI during the failure was 16.5, while the global P95 threshold was 0.0, resulting in a deviation of 16.5. This significant deviation suggests that memory page faults in the `productcatalogservice-0` container could be the root cause reason for the observed anomalies.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1.

If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nDuring the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:30 to 10:00, the cloudbed-1 system experienced a single failure. The exact time of the root cause occurrence is currently unknown, which complicates the failure diagnosis process. Please identify the root cause occurrence datetime.\n\nSolve the issue step-by-step. In each step, your response should follow the JSON format below:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'. Respond \'None\' if it is the first step.),\n    "completed": ("True" if you believe the issue is resolved, and an answer can be derived in the \'instruction\' field.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nDuring the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:30 to 10:00, the cloudbed-1 system experienced a single failure. The exact time of the root cause occurrence is currently unknown, which complicates the failure diagnosis process. Please identify the root cause occurrence datetime.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1.

Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes.

In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage.

Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results.

The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5.

This microservice system is a E-commerce platform which includes a failover mechanism, with each service deployed across four pods. In this system, a container (pod) can be deployed in different nodes. If the root cause component is a single pod of a specific service (e.g., node-1.adservice-0), the failure may not significantly impact the corresponding service metrics. In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage. The specific names of these KPIs can be found in the `kpi_name` field.\n\n3. Note that the `cmdb_id` is the name of specific components, including nodes, pods, services, etc.\n\n-  Metrics:\n    -  Runtime: The application name and port, e.g., `adservice.ts:8088`\n    -  Service: The service name and protocol, e.g., `adservic-grpc`\n    -  Container: The pod name combined with a node name, e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`\n    -  Node: The node name, e.g., `node-1`\n    -  Mesh: The service-to-service connection identifier within the mesh, e.g.,`cartservice-1.source.cartservice.redis-cart`\n\n-  Traces: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n-  Logs: The pod name, e.g., `adservice-0`\n\n4. In different telemetry files, the timestamp units and cmdb_id formats may vary:\n\n- Metric: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647781200). cmdb_id varies by metric file:\n    - In container metrics: `<node>-x.<service>-x` (e.g., `node-1.adservice-0`)\n    - In node metrics: `<node>-x` (e.g., `node-1`)\n    - In service metrics: `<service>-grpc` (e.g., `adservice-grpc`)\n\n- Trace: Timestamp units are in milliseconds (e.g., 1647705600361). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., frontend-0).\n\n- Log: Timestamp units are in seconds (e.g., 1647705660). cmdb_id is consistently `<service>-x` (e.g., currencyservice-0).\n\n5. Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

In contrast, if the root cause component is a service itself (e.g., adservice), which means all pods of this service are faulty, the corresponding service metrics will be significantly impacted. Moreover, such fault could be propagate through the call chain, resulting in other service\'s metrics faulty. Note that `Pod` equals to `Container` in this system.\n\n2. The `metric_service.csv` file only contains four KPIs: rr, sr, mrt, and count. In contrast, other metric files record a variety of KPIs, such as CPU usage and memory usage.

Please use the UTC+8 time zone in all analysis steps since system is deployed in China/Hong Kong/Singapore.\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**\n\nThe issue you are going to solve is:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Continue your reasoning process for the target issue:\n\nThe cloud service system, cloudbed-1, experienced one failure within the time range of March 20, 2022, from 09:00 to 09:30. The specific component responsible for this failure and the underlying reason are currently unknown. You are tasked with identifying the root cause component and the root cause reason.\n\nFollow the rules during issue solving:\n\n## RULES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS:\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. **Follow the workflow of `preprocess -> anomaly detection -> fault identification -> root cause localization` for failure diagnosis.** \n    1.1. Preprocess:\n        - Aggregate each KPI of each components that are possible to be the root cause component to obtain multiple time series classified by \'component-KPI\' (e.g., service_A-cpu_usage_pct).\n        - Then, calculate global thresholds (e.g., global P95, where \'global\' means the threshold of all \'component-KPI\' time series within a whole metric file) for each \'component-KPI\' time series. - Finally, filter data within the given time duration for all time series to perform further analysis.\n        - Since the root cause component must be selected from the provided possible root cause components, all other level\'s components (e.g., service mesh components, middleware components, etc.) should be ignored.\n    1.2. Anomaly detection: \n        - An anomaly is typically a data point that exceeds the global threshold.\n        - Look for anomalies below a certain threshold (e.g., <=P95, <=P15, or <=P5) in traffic KPIs or business KPIs (e.g., success rate (ss)) since some network failures can cause a sudden drop on them due to packet loss.\n        - Loose the global threshold (e.g., from >=P95 to >=P90, or from <=P95 to <=P15, <=P5) if you really cannot find any anomalies.\n    1.3. Fault identification: \n        - A \'fault\' is a consecutive sub-series of a specific component-KPI time series. Thus, fault identification is the process of identifying which components experienced faults, on which resources, and at what occurrence time points.\n        - Filter out isolated noise spikes to locate faults.\n        - Faults where the maximum (or minimum) value in the sub-series only slightly exceeds (or falls below) the threshold (e.g., threshold breach <= 50% of the extremal), it¡¯s likely a false positive caused by random KPI fluctuations, and should be excluded.\n    1.4. Root cause localization: \n        - The objective of root cause localization is to determine which identified \'fault\' is the root cause of the failure. The root cause occurrence time, component, and reason can be derived from the first piece of data point of that fault.\n        - If multiple faulty components are identified at **different levels** (e.g., some being containers and others nodes), and all of them are potential root cause candidates, while the issue itself describes a **single failure**, the root cause level should be determined by the fault that shows the most significant deviation from the threshold (i.e., >> 50%). However, this method is only applicable to identify the root cause level, not the root cause component. If there are multiple faulty components at the same level, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component.\n        - If multiple service-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** service within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty services.\n        - If multiple container-level faulty components are identified, the root cause component is typically the last (the most downstream in a call chain) **faulty** container within a trace. Use traces to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty container.\n        - If multiple node-level faulty components are identified and the issue doesn\'t specify **a single failure**, each of these nodes might be the root cause of separate failures. Otherwise, the predominant nodes with the most faults is the root cause component. The node-level failure do not propagate, and trace only captures communication between all containers or all services.\n        - If only one component\'s one resource KPI has one fault occurred in a specific time, that fault is the root cause. Otherwise, you should use traces and logs to identify the root cause component and reason.\n2. **Follow the order of `threshold calculation -> data extraction -> metric analyis -> trace analysis -> log analysis` for failure diagnosis.** \n    2.0. Before analysis: You should extract and filter the data to include those within the failure duration only after the global threshold has been calculated. After these two steps, you can perform metric analysis, trace analysis, and log analysis.\n    2.1. Metric analysis: Use metrics to calculate whether each KPIs of each component has consecutive anomalies beyond the global threshold is the fastest way to find the faults. Since there are a large number of traces and logs, metrics analysis should first be used to narrow down the search space of duration and components.\n    2.2. Trace analysis: Use traces can further localize which container-level or service-level faulty component is the root cause components when there are multiple faulty components at the same level (container or service) identified by metrics analysis.\n    2.3. Log analysis: Use logs can further localize which resource is the root cause reason when there are multiple faulty resource KPIs of a component identified by metrics analysis. Logs can also help to identify the root cause component among multiple faulty components at the same level.\n    2.4. Always confirm whether the target key or field is valid (e.g., component\'s name, KPI\'s name, trace ID, log ID, etc.) when Executor\'s retrieval result is empty.\n\nWhat you SHOULD NOT do:\n\n1. **DO NOT include any programming language (Python) in your response.** Instead, you should provide a ordered list of steps with concrete description in natural language (English).\n2. **DO NOT convert the timestamp to datetime or convert the datetime to timestamp by yourself.** These detailed process will be handled by the Executor.\n3. **DO NOT use the local data (filtered/cached series in specific time duration) to calculate the global threshold of aggregated \'component-KPI\' time series.** Always use the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file (typically includes one day\'s KPIs) to calculate the threshold. To obtain global threshold, you can first aggregate each component\'s each KPI to calculate their threshold, and then retrieve the objective time duration of aggregated \'component-KPI\' to perform anomaly detection and spike filtering.\n4. **DO NOT visualize the data or draw pictures or graphs via Python.** The Executor can only provide text-based results. Never include the `matplotlib` or `seaborn` library in the code.\n5. **DO NOT save anything in the local file system.** Cache the intermediate results in the IPython Kernel. Never use the bash command in the code cell.\n6. **DO NOT calculate threshold AFTER filtering data within the given time duration.** Always calculate global thresholds using the entire KPI series of a specific component within a metric file BEFORE filtering data within the given time duration.\n7. **DO NOT query a specific KPI without knowing which KPIs are available.** Different systems may have completely different KPI naming conventions. If you want to query a specific KPI, first ensure that you are aware of all the available KPIs.\n8. **DO NOT mistakenly identify a healthy (non-faulty) service at the downstream end of a trace that includes faulty components as the root cause.** The root cause component should be the most downstream **faulty** service to appear within the trace call chain, which must first and foremost be a FAULTY component identified by metrics analysis.\n9. **DO NOT focus solely on warning or error logs during log analysis. Many info logs contain critical information about service operations and interactions between services, which can be valuable for root cause analysis.**.\n\nResponse format:\n\n{\n    "analysis": (Your analysis of the code execution result from Executor in the last step, with detailed reasoning of \'what have been done\' and \'what can be derived\'.
